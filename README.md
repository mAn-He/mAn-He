# Ho-Seung Kang (Í∞ïÌò∏Ïäπ)
> A problem-solving researcher who tackles real-world, persistent challenges using data and AI.

<br>

## üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è About Me
- I transitioned from Forest Products & Biotechnology to AI to solve real-world inefficiencies, expanding my expertise as a Visiting Scholar at Carnegie Mellon University.
- I enjoy achieving quantifiable results by identifying and solving the root causes of problems, whether by redesigning data structures or overcoming system limitations.
- Currently, my research is focused on Multimodal Learning and AI for Science, with a deep interest in Materials Informatics.

## ‚ú® Featured Projects
* **[Background-Robust Person Re-ID via Multimodal Enhancement](https://github.com/mAn-He/kpr_mm)**
    * Designed and implemented a Zero-Shot network to improve the generalization performance of Person Re-ID in new environments without retraining, leveraging Generative AI (Stable Diffusion) and multimodal techniques (LLaVA, CLIP).
    * `Multimodal`, `Generative AI`, `Person Re-ID`, `PyTorch`, `WACV Submitted`

* **[Science VQA Model based on Gemma-CLIP](https://github.com/mAn-He/gemmaclip)**
    * Engineered a lightweight, End-to-End VLM architecture specialized for the 'AI for Science' domain by combining a lightweight language model (Gemma) with an image-text understanding model (CLIP) and applying PEFT (QLoRA).
    * `VLM`, `AI for Science`, `PEFT`, `Gemma`, `CLIP`

* **[AI-Powered Autonomous Cannon System Optimization](https://github.com/mAn-He/John_Wick)**
    * Resolved a communication bottleneck in a constrained edge device environment, improving system processing speed (FPS) by 116% through software optimization alone, including a custom 'Frame Drop' algorithm and ONNX model conversion.
    * `System Optimization`, `Edge AI`, `C++`, `ONNX`, `Team Leadership`

* **[AI-Based Anomaly Detection & Segmentation in Aquaculture](https://github.com/mAn-He/olive_flounder)**
    * Resolved data ambiguity by applying a Data-Centric labeling strategy that redefined overlapping objects as a 'third class', improving the F1 Score by 7.8%p without any model changes.
    * `Data-Centric AI`, `Semantic Segmentation`, `Problem Solving`
