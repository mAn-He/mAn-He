## ‚ú® Featured Projects
* **[Background-Robust Person Re-ID via Multimodal Enhancement](https://github.com/mAn-He/kpr_mm)**
    * [cite_start]Designed and implemented a Zero-Shot network to improve the generalization performance of Person Re-ID in new environments without retraining, leveraging Generative AI (Stable Diffusion) and multimodal techniques (LLaVA, CLIP). [cite: 127, 128, 244, 245]
    * `Multimodal`, `Generative AI`, `Person Re-ID`, `PyTorch`, `WACV Submitted`

* **[Science VQA Model based on Gemma-CLIP](https://github.com/mAn-He/gemmaclip)**
    * [cite_start]Engineered a lightweight, End-to-End VLM architecture specialized for the 'AI for Science' domain by combining a lightweight language model (Gemma) with an image-text understanding model (CLIP) and applying PEFT (QLoRA). [cite: 136, 152, 224]
    * `VLM`, `AI for Science`, `PEFT`, `Gemma`, `CLIP`

* **[AI-Powered Autonomous Cannon System Optimization](https://github.com/mAn-He/cmu-autonomous-cannon)**
    * [cite_start]Resolved a communication bottleneck in a constrained edge device environment, improving system processing speed (FPS) by 116% through software optimization alone, including a custom 'Frame Drop' algorithm and ONNX model conversion. [cite: 71, 72, 74, 230, 231, 232]
